    <hr class="solid">
<p> Putting the Networking research into different sections and deciding how I'm going to write this survey paper.</p>
<p> Yes it is super boring. No I don't want to do it, but I'm going to bite the bullet and get it done, even if that means late night library trips.</p>
<p> Going to focus on the layout, content structure and research needed. Then just write my heart out. I just need to remember</p>
<h2 style="color: red;"> IT DOESN'T NEED TO BE PERFECT, JUST PASSABLE, THEN I CAN ADD AND REARRANGE FOR A BETTER MARK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</h2>
