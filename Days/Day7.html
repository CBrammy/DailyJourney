 <p>Idling Runescape is my new hobby, made a hardcore ironman, let's see how long he survives </p>
 <p>Got some work done towards the networking assignment due in 2 weeks.</p>
 <p>Reading about tower cells in 5G is infinitely boring, but the flow of the survey paper I need to write is taking shape.</p>
